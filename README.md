# WpfPerlinNoise
What started as re-learning WPF ended with making a 2D perlin noise generator. All in the name of de-rusting.

TODO:
Generate the noise images asynchronusly to prevent the stuttering when changinf all controls.
Clean code.
Write comments that are actually worth anything.

IDEAS:
Implement colour gradents so that the image provided looks like islands/mountins.
Implemnet 3D Noise and animate a lava/star animation.
